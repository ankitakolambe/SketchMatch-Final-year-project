## 📄 DESCRIPTION / ABSTRACT  

In forensic science, hand-drawn face sketches are still limited and time-consuming when integrated with modern technologies used for criminal recognition and identification.  
This project presents a **standalone application** that enables users to:

- Create composite face sketches of suspects using a **drag-and-drop interface**, eliminating the need for professional forensic artists.
- Automatically match the created sketches with a police face database using **deep learning algorithms** and **cloud infrastructure** for **fast and efficient identification**.
